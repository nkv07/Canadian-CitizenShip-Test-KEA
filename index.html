    <h1>Privacy Policy for Canadian Citizenship Test-KEA</h1>
    <p>Last updated: June 13, 2023</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information Canadian Citizenship Test-KEA (the "App") collects, and how it
        is used. By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

    <!-- Similar structure for sections 1 to 10 -->
    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>The App keeps track of your average scores and stores them in a local SQLite database on your device. This data is solely for your use and reference. No personal data is stored by the App. The developer is not responsible for any loss of data due to your use of the device or App and does not provide any guarantees regarding data integrity.</p>
    <h2>Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
    <p>The App is available for free download and limited content access but offers full access through subscriptions and lifetime use options, available for purchase via Google Play Store or App Store, as the case maybe. A lifetime subscription is valid as long as the developer continues to maintain the App, deemed economically feasible. The developer reserves the right to discontinue the Appâ€™s development and maintenance. In such cases, the users cannot hold the developer liable or claim refunds for lifetime subscriptions.</p>
    <h2>Educational Purpose</h2>
    <p>The App is developed for educational purposes to aid users in preparing for the Canadian Citizenship Test. However, the App does not guarantee that users will pass the test by using it. It should be used as a supplementary tool in your preparation.</p>
    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>The developer makes no warranties regarding the accuracy, reliability, or completeness of the content provided in the App. The developer shall not be liable for any errors, mistakes, omissions, or negligence in the questions or content published in the App. By using the App, you agree not to hold the developer legally responsible or sue for any mistakes or omissions in the content.</p>
    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All content within the App, including text, graphics, logos, images, as well as the compilation thereof, and any software used on the App, is the property of the developer or its suppliers and is protected by copyright and other laws that protect intellectual property and proprietary rights.</p>
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App may have links to third-party websites or services that are not governed by this privacy policy. In-app purchases and payments are handled by Google Play Store or the App Store, and the App may integrate third party transaction management services for tracking transactions. The developer does not collect or store any personal data regarding these transactions.</p>
    <h2>User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>Users are responsible for the security of their devices and for ensuring that any content from the App is used in a manner that complies with applicable laws and regulations.</p>
    <h2>Children&apos;s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is intended for individuals over the age of 13. The App itself does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information. In-app purchases are conducted through Google Play Store or the App Store, which have their age restrictions.</p>
    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>The developer reserves the right to update this Privacy Policy as necessary. Therefore, it's recommended to review this page periodically. Your continued use of the App after changes to this Privacy Policy is deemed as acceptance of those changes.</p>
    <h2>Governing Law</h2>
    <p>This policy and the use of the App are governed by Canadian law. If a lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted under this policy, you and the developer agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the provincial and federal courts located within Canada</p>
